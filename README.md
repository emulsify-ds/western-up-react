# Western University of Pennsylvania React Components

The components in this repo are the "Organization" components that all React projects under the fictitious "Western University of Pennsylvania" brand can, and should use when appropriate in order to maintain brand consistency across web properties.

## Code Guidelines Used By This Project

- Components should be named using UpperCamelCase (PascalCase).
- Stories for a single component should also use UpperCamelCase.
- Directories for a single component should also use UpperCamelCase and have the same name as the component it contains.
- Directories that contain a collection of components should be lowercase and use the plural form of the type of component.
- Stories that contain a collection of components follow the same rule as their containing directory.
